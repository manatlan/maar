# MAAR (My Android Auto Radio)

With python3's [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag) module.

To build the apk, use [make.py](make.md), it's a command-line which should help you to create an apk.


## notes

This is a POC, just to see if the whole idea is OK.

history:  I've got an android auto radio, with a 1280x480 (6.86") ... I don't like the current music player. So i try to replace it with something of my own.
It's just to try if an android apk, using htag, can replace the current app.
