# MAAR (My Android Auto Radio)

With python3's [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag) module.

Android's Apk built thru the [htagapk recipe](https://github.com/manatlan/htagapk)

Build the APK using "Actions > Build Apk > Run workflow", the package.zip(apk) is available after 11-to-13 minutes in the resulted process ;-)

## notes

This is a POC, just to see if the whole idea is OK.

history:  I've got an android auto radio, with a 1280x480 (6.86") ... I don't like the current music player. So i try to replace it with something of my own.
It's just to try if an android apk, using htag, can replace the current app.
